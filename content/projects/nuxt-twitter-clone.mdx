# Fullstack Twitter Clone

[Demo](https://nuxt-twitter-clone-sigma.vercel.app/)

### Overview
This project is a fully functional Twitter clone built using **Nuxt 3** for the front-end and back-end. The application allows users to create accounts, log in, post tweets (with media support), and interact with other users' content. I implemented a variety of technologies and services to ensure that the app is secure, scalable, and user-friendly.

### Features
- **User Authentication**: Users can create accounts and log in securely with hashed passwords.
- **Media Uploads**: Users can upload images or videos with their posts, stored securely in the cloud.
- **Interactive Timeline**: Users can post, like, and interact with tweets in real time.
- **Readable Timestamps**: Each post is displayed with a human-readable timestamp for better UX.

### Tech Stack

#### Frontend
- **Nuxt 3**: A powerful Vue.js framework used for building both the frontend and backend of the app, ensuring a smooth and optimized user experience.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework that speeds up the development of responsive and modern designs.
- **Heroicons**: A simple and elegant icon library that provides a consistent look throughout the app.

#### Backend
- **Nuxt 3 Server-Side**: I leveraged the backend capabilities of Nuxt 3 to handle user authentication, post creation, and API interactions.
- **Prisma ORM**: Used for managing database interactions in a type-safe manner, ensuring efficient and optimized queries to the database.
- **Mitt**: A tiny event emitter that handles real-time event management across components, enabling features like live tweet updates.
- **Formidable**: Handles form data and file uploads, including large media files, efficiently in the backend.

#### Media Management
- **Cloudinary**: A cloud-based media management service used for uploading and storing images and videos attached to tweets, ensuring fast loading times and high availability.

#### Security
- **bcrypt**: Used for securely hashing user passwords before they are stored in the database, providing strong protection for sensitive user data.

#### Time Management
- **human-time**: Converts standard timestamps into more user-friendly, readable time formats, enhancing the user experience on tweet timestamps (e.g., "5 minutes ago").

#### Routing and URL Patterns
- **url-pattern**: Used for matching and parsing dynamic URL routes in the backend, allowing the app to be highly flexible with its routing logic.

### Key Takeaways
- **Scalability**: The project is built to be easily scalable. With **Nuxt 3** handling both frontend and backend, and **Cloudinary** taking care of media storage, the app is designed to handle a large number of users and media uploads without performance degradation.
- **Security**: Using **bcrypt** for password hashing ensures that user data is protected. Prisma's secure database interactions and server-side rendering with Nuxt make the application robust.
- **Performance**: Optimized with tools like **Tailwind** and **Cloudinary**, ensuring fast load times and responsive design across all devices.
- **Real-Time Interaction**: With **Mitt** and **human-time**, users can interact with posts in real-time and enjoy a smooth, engaging experience.
