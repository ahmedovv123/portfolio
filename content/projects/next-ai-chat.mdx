A modern chat application built with Nuxt, Vue, and TypeScript, designed for extensibility and developer productivity.
This project demonstrates full-stack development, authentication, markdown rendering, and seamless integration with GitHub.

## Features

- **GitHub Authentication**: Secure login using OAuth, with automatic user creation and demo data seeding.
- **Markdown Rendering**: Rich markdown support for chat messages, including tables, code blocks, and GFM extensions.
- **User Management**: Robust user repository with provider-based identification.
- **Demo Data Seeding**: Automatic population of demo data for new users to enhance onboarding.
- **Responsive UI**: Styled components for readable and accessible chat content.
- **Layered Architecture**: Separation of concerns with clear layers for authentication, data, and UI.

## Technologies

- **Nuxt**: The core framework for building the application, enabling SSR and modular architecture.
- **Vue 3**: Used for building reactive UI components.
- **TypeScript**: Ensures type safety and maintainability across the codebase.
- **Prisma**: ORM for database access, providing type-safe queries and migrations.
- **pnpm**: Fast, disk-efficient package manager for managing dependencies.
- **MDX**: Used for documentation and rendering markdown with embedded components.
- **GitHub OAuth**: Handles authentication and user identity.
- **Markdown Utilities**: Libraries like `mdast-util-gfm`, `markdown-table`, and `magic-string` for advanced markdown parsing and rendering.

## Configuration & Tooling

- **pnpm**: Dependency management is handled via `pnpm`, ensuring fast installs and strict versioning.
- **Prisma**: Database models and migrations are managed with Prisma, simplifying data access and schema evolution.
- **Custom Components**: The `MarkdownRenderer.vue` component provides styled markdown output, leveraging scoped CSS for consistent appearance.
- **Layered Structure**: The project is organized into layers (`auth`, `base`, etc.) for scalability and maintainability.
- **TypeScript**: All business logic and API interactions are written in TypeScript for reliability.

## Why This Project?

This chat application showcases best practices in modern web development, including authentication, markdown processing, and clean architecture. It is a solid foundation for real-time communication platforms, knowledge bases, or collaborative tools.
